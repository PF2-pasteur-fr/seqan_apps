Clean NGS -- TODO
=================

 * By default, print user-friendly output to stderr.  Add an option with the
   log files for Bernd's statistics scripts.

 * Document adapter file definition in text section. See:
   http://trac.seqan.de/wiki/Tutorial/ParsingCommandLineArguments

 * Create more comprehensive list of tests.  Should include adapters
   at the end and in the middle of the read, quality based trimming on
   each side.

 * Tests with paired end data are important and should be added.

 * Adaptor placement with paired end reads.

 * Windows/Unix

 * Ns are allowed in the adapter sequence.

 * Possibly add option to annotate read id/meta data line with
   information about leader sequence or adapter.  E.g. (I recommend 1):

   (1) char buffer[1000];
       snprintf(buffer, 999, " foo bar %d %d", 1, 2);
       append(record.id1, buffer);

   (2) std::stringstream ss;
       ss << " foo bar " << 1 << " " << 2;
       append(record.id1, ss.str());
       // ss.str(""); ss.clear();

 * Benchmark against old version.

 * Test in KNIME.
